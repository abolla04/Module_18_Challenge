## Blockchain-Based Ledger System with Web Interface

This is a blockchain-based ledger system with a web interface that allows partner banks to transfer funds.  The integrity of the data is verified in the ledger.  

As shown in the visual below, the user will input sender and receiver information along with the amount to be transfered.  The transactions are logged once the "Add Block" button is clicked.
